# Distance-Based LED Indicator
This Arduino project uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and lights up LEDs based on how close an object is.

## Concept
1. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Measures the distance to an object
2. LED1 (Red): Turns ON if distance < 20 cm
3. LED2 (Yellow): Turns ON if distance < 30 cm
4. LED3 (Green): Turns ON if distance < 40 cm

## Arduino IDE setup 
1. Download the Arduino IDE from: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2. Install the IDE and connect your Arduino via USB.
3. Open the .ino file and upload the code to the board.
